In today's fast-paced world, productivity has become more important than ever. Whether you're a student, a working professional, or a business owner, you need to be productive to achieve your goals and stay ahead of the competition. But productivity isn't always easy to achieve. It requires focus, discipline, and motivation, and it's easy to get sidetracked by distractions, procrastination, and lack of direction.
</div>

<div class="border p-2 m-4 text-center aquamarine rounded-2xl">
That's where the "Eat the Frog" method comes in. This productivity method, popularized by Brian Tracy in his book "Eat That Frog!", is based on the idea that you should tackle your most challenging task (or "frog") first thing in the morning, when you have the most energy and focus. By doing so, you'll build momentum and confidence, and the rest of your day will feel more manageable.
</div>

<div class="p-2 m-4 text-center">
Introducing Froggy Focus - a web app built with JavaScript that takes the "Eat the Frog" method to the next level. With Froggy Focus, you'll be able to build a gamification system around this powerful productivity method and use Deep Learning in-app to achieve your productivity goals.
